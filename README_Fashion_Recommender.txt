Fashion Recommendation System
=============================

An AI-powered recommendation system that suggests visually similar fashion products and complementary outfit items based on an uploaded image.

Built using ResNet50, k-NN, and Streamlit, this project delivers real-time recommendations with a clean and interactive UI.

Features
--------
- Image-Based Recommendations
  Upload a fashion product image to find visually similar items using deep learning features.

- Occasion-Based Complementary Suggestions
  Get smart outfit recommendations (e.g., sunglasses for a t-shirt) using metadata and custom category mapping.

- Randomized Selection
  Avoids repetition by randomly selecting unique products per category.

- Streamlit Web App
  User-friendly interface to upload images and view recommendations instantly.

Tech Stack
----------
- Python
- TensorFlow (ResNet50) – Image feature extraction
- scikit-learn (k-NN) – Similarity search
- Pandas & NumPy – Data processing
- Streamlit – Web UI
- PIL / OpenCV – Image handling

Dataset
-------
- Product Metadata: Cleaned CSV with articleType, gender, and usage tags.
- Image Folder: Product images named by product ID for feature matching.

How It Works
------------
1. User uploads an image.
2. System extracts features using ResNet50.
3. k-NN finds top visually similar products.
4. Metadata is used to suggest occasion-based complementary items.
5. Unique products are selected via randomized filtering.

Future Enhancements
-------------------
- Integrate real-time product APIs (Myntra, Ajio, Flipkart)
- Pinterest-style outfit styling suggestions
- Mobile app support with live camera capture
- Expand to real-time recommendations with scalable backends
