Fashion e-commerce platforms offer vast product collections, making it challenging for users to find relevant items. This project develops an image-based fashion recommendation system that suggests visually similar products and occasion-based complementary items. It utilizes deep learning for feature extraction, KNN for similarity search, and a mapping-based approach for personalized outfit recommendations. The system is implemented as a web application using Streamlit.
